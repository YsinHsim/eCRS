# eCRS
System for my ITS332 mini project. Created for student to pick room for their college after their application has been accepted.

# I am using html, css, bootstrap, and phpmyadmin in order to create this system. Which is still work in progress.

For the database, i named it as ecrs via phpmyadmin.

# To setup the system :
1. Install xampp( phpmyadmin).
2. Create a folder called ecrs in htdocs in your xampp folder, if you're using linux put it in /opt/lampp/htdocs/"created ecrs"/
3. Create a database called ecrs and import ecrs(1).sql into your ecrs database.
4. Test it on your browser at localhost/ecrs.
